# A game of Guess The Number on the console

The computer randomly chooses a number and the player has 10 attempts to guess it.<br>
The player is given clues whether they are getting close and when the difference from the number to guess is 5 or less the message will say that they are getting really close.<br>
The option for restarting the game or ending the program is present.<br>

I added a little method to simulate the computer thinking of a number.
